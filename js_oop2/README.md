# JS OOP Prototype

### Featureset 1 - counter basic

![counter example](assets/counterdemo.gif) (please note that this shows all 3 counters running)

- This counter displays a number in an existing dom element, and can be clicked on to increment the value in the dom element



### Featureset 2 - counter medium

#### you should not copy the code from counter basic.  Make it new to get more practice!  The object has different requirements, as well!

- This object is much like the first one, except it makes its own dom element.  It can also be clicked on to increase the number



### Featureset 3 - counter callback

- This object, like the previous two, increases a dom element's value by 1 whenever the element is clicked on.  This one, however, includes a callback function to notify other code that the element has been clicked on



### Featureset 4 - name capper

![counter example](assets/namedemo.gif)

- this object displays a string and allows that text to be lowercased or uppercased when the dom element is clicked


### Featureset 5 - christmas light

![counter example](assets/lightdemo.gif)

- this object takes in an array of colors, and cycles through those colors when you click on the element
